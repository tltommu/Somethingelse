**A simple web game for me to learn storing data**
---
The data are simply levels and experience( which are useless at the moment, maybe I will add some functions in the future to make it useful)

As the file is in json with only two lines, it could easily be edited.

Built using vanila JS function and display the results through HTML.

The battle process could be simply checked by inspecting the website and it's logged on the console
